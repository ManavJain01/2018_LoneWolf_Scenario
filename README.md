## Finding the digital evidences for planning for mass shooting using Disk Forensics


### 2018_LoneWolf_Scenario
The 2018 Lone Wolf scenario is a set of materials from the a fictional seizure of a laptop of a fictional individual who was planning a mass shooting. In the scenario, the individualâ€™s brother alerted the police regarding the increasingly concerning behavior of his brother. As a result of the alert, the police seized the brotherâ€™s laptop. The laptop was then imaged with the FTK Imager program.

### Forensic Data
This scenario was created by Thomas Moore, a student at George Mason University, as his final project for CRFS 780: Cloud Forensics, taught in Spring 2018 by Simson Garfinkel. The purpose of the scenario is to give students the chance to work with a dataset that contains cloud artifacts left on clients, and to provide a scenario with a realistic size.

The seizure consists of the following materials:
